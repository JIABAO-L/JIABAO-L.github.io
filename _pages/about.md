I am a researcher with a strong interest in Information Security, **currently seeking Ph.D. opportunities**.

I received a B. Eng. in Information Security from the School of Computer and Information Engineering at Henan University, and an M.S. in Internet of Things from the Faculty of Science and Technology at the University of Macau.

My research focuses on **Cryptography, Data Security, and Privacy Preservation**. Specifically, I apply cryptographic techniques to address security challenges in emerging technologies, such as the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Brain-Computer Interfaces, and Smart Grids. I am dedicated to exploring the optimal balance between system security and practical usability. My goal is to develop innovative theoretical frameworks and deployable technical solutions that address privacy and security challenges in the real world.
