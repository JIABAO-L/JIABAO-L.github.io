To solve the problems that the identification accuracy and stability of the single-layer identification scheme are deteriorated due to the increase in the number of cryptographic algorithms, the complexity of ciphertext data and the increase of interference between data, a hybrid gradient boosting decision tree and logistic regression (HGBDTLR) model were proposed, and a block cipher algorithm identification scheme based on this model (HGLBIS) was constructed. In this scheme, 15 NIST randomness testing methods were used as the ciphertext feature extraction methods to extract features from the ciphertext files, and 10 meaningful feature values were selected as the input to the classifier; then these 10 feature values were used to train a gradient boosting decision tree model, and the trees generated from its learning were used to construct new features; finally, the new features were one-hot encoded, and added to the original features to train the logistic regression model. In the ciphertext only scenario, nine different cryptographic algorithm identification schemes were constructed based on nine different classifier models. Then, these nine schemes were used to perform binary classification of block ciphers experiments on ciphertext files of different sizes encrypted by two typical block cipher algorithms AES and 3DES, and five classification of block ciphers experiments on ciphertext files of different sizes encrypted by five commonly-used block cipher algorithms AES, 3DES, Blowfish, CAST and RC2. The experimental results showed that, compared with the existing identification schemes, when the size of ciphertext files is the same, the scheme proposed in this paper has almost the highest identification accuracy on both the binary classification and five classifications of block ciphers. At the same time, with the change of the size of ciphertext files, the identification accuracy shows a fluctuating change. In conclusion, the proposed scheme has the smallest fluctuation range, the smallest degree of influence and the highest stability.
